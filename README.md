# :wine_glass: Vínbúðin min/max :wine_glass:
A simple R script to figure out the most efficient alcoholic beverage in Iceland's state owned monopoly on alcohol.
This script calls the same endpoint as the website itself but retrieves the entire selection of products available.

Originally I meant to put this up as a novelty website but Vínbúðin seems to be quite protective of their data being distributed without their consent and I am in no mood to have a months long email correspondence or get sued.

This project has been canned but feel free to run the code for yourselves.
